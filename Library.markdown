* Principal–agent problem [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal%E2%80%93agent_problem)
* The Paradox of Value [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_value)
  * Why is a diamond much more valuable than a glass of water? 
  > Price is determined by a good's marginal utility. The marginal utility of a good is derived from its most important use to a person. So, if someone possesses a good, they will use it to satisfy some need or want, starting with the one that takes highest priority. Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk illustrated this with the example of a farmer having five sacks of grain.[7]
* Does immigration import inequality? [Economist (Paywall)](https://www.economist.com/britain/2020/09/26/does-immigration-import-inequality)

    > Contrary to common knowledge, de-growth is not necessary to solve climate change.
    > A number of countries – such as the USA, UK, France, Spain, Italy, and many others – have managed to reduce emissions (even when we correct for trade) whilst increasing GDP.
