Hi everyone, apologies for the radio silence as of late. We’ll be resuming this newsletter on a weekly basis and the good news is we have the next 6 months already programmed, so stay tuned! This week’s Three Interesting Things are:

1\. “In the more gender-equal countries, men have “more male” interests, and the women have “more female” interests.&nbsp; But for the less gender-specific interests, greater equality ends up resulting.” - fascinating, and makes a lot of sense to me. &nbsp;

2\. The number of oil spills has been decreasing significantly over time:

3\. Both Men and Women are overconfident, contrary to popular opinion:
