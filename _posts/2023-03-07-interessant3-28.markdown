This week is a double issue due to being AFK, and I’ve also left an easter egg link below, enjoy!

1. Market participation make people act more morally towards strangers. 

> “We document a robust positive association between market participation and moral behaviour towards anonymous others. Market-integrated participants display universalism in moral decision-making, whereas non-market participants make more moral decisions towards co-villagers.”

2. SE Asian countries have reduced measles cases by 90% in 17 years. Really impressive and [probably not on the news](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/17/steven-pinker-media-negative-news)! See the correlation with vaccinations: !
3. The concept of Holacracy is an interesting one for organisational governance, although it apparently means a lot more time in meetings and existing real-world examples aren’t exactly great: 

> “A method of decentralized management and organizational governance, which claims to distribute authority and decision-making through a holarchy of self-organizing teams rather than being vested in a management hierarchy. Holacracy has been adopted by for-profit and non-profit organizations in several countries.”
