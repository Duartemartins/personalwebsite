1. By one metric, we’ve over-corrected on gender equality significantly, and are now heavily discriminating against men. My uncontroversial (I hope) take is that discrimination of any kind is bad by definition. This affects a small proportion of the population that is on average fairly well-off, but is unacceptable nonetheless.

> Currently, women are 3-15 times more likely to be selected as members of the AAAS (American Academy of Arts and Science) and NAS (National Academy of Science) than men with similar publication and citation records.

1. On a more positive note, the&nbsp;[American Cancer Society](https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/breast-cancer-facts-and-figures/2022-2024-breast-cancer-fact-figures-acs.pdf) &nbsp;says breast cancer death rates in the United States dropped by (a whopping) 43% between 1989 and 2020. As a result, 460,000 breast cancer deaths were averted in US women during this period. The average five year survival rate is now **over 90%** (emphasis mine) - up from around 70% back in the early 1980s. !
2. In the UK, and I would wager in most of the developed world, recycling is actually worse for the environment than not recycling, since a high proportion of waste destined for recycling gets shipped overseas to countries that dispose of it directly into waterways and oceans. Bonus fact from the article: 

> “You’d need to use an organic cotton bag 150 times in order for it to be energy-efficient compared to using a supermarket plastic bag **once**. (emphasis mine)”
