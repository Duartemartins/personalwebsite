1. Considered one of the top 10 Global Health Threats by the WHO, Dengue fever is a disease endemic to over 100 countries, and spreading. Globally reported cases increased from 500,000/year in 2000 to 5 million in in 2019, with modelling estimating the real figure to be a staggering 390 million infections a year, and about 36,000 deaths. Worryingly, there was no Dengue-specific treatment, until very recently. Japanese pharma company Takeda has developed a Dengue vaccine, which in studies has prevented 84% of hospitalizations and 61% of symptomatic Dengue illness overall, with no identified important safety risks. It has been approved in the EU and Brazil, a **huge** win you probably didn’t hear about in the news. https://www.takeda.com/newsroom/newsreleases/2022/takedas-dengue-vaccine-candidate-provides-continued-protection-against-dengue-fever-through-4.5-years-in-pivotal-clinical-trial 
2. Recently, studies have shown that social media use is a causal driver of mental illness. This study however, shows that the age at which a child is given a phone does not influence sleep patterns, depression symptoms or grades. Parents, rejoice, kind of. We should of course be sceptical of individual studies and guide ourselves on the body of scientific literature.https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2022/11/children-mobile-phone-age.html
