## Speed up Your Development with the Rails Starter Template for IndieHackers

I'm excited to share with you a Rails starter template I've created to help speed up your development process. This template comes with user authentication via Devise, subscription payments via the Pay gem, and PostgreSQL as the database. It's designed to help you quickly set up your Rails application with user authentication and subscription payments, allowing you to focus on building your product.

The template includes the following features:

- Devise for user authentication
- Pay gem for handling subscription payments with Stripe
- PostgreSQL as the database
- Out of the box payment support using Stripe Checkout
- Payment and Subscription management using Stripe Billing

To get started with this template, you can follow the instructions provided in the README file. The README covers all the necessary steps for setting up the template, including cloning the repository, configuring your PostgreSQL database, generating a Rails secret key, setting up Stripe API keys, and updating the Stripe price ID in the controller.

By using this template, you'll be able to quickly launch your Rails application with essential features like user authentication and subscription payments already implemented. This will save you valuable time and effort, allowing you to focus on building and iterating on your product.

You can find the Rails starter template on GitHub: https://github.com/Duartemartins/rails-starter-template

For more information on the gems used in this template, you can refer to their documentation:

I hope this template helps you speed up your development process and enables you to launch your product faster. If you have any questions, suggestions, or feedback, feel free to reach out.

Happy coding!
