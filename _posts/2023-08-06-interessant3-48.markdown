1. National histories of slavery and colonialism are neither necessary nor sufficient conditions for a country to have labour market discrimination. https://sociologicalscience.com/download/vol-6/june/SocSci\_v6\_467to496.pdf ! 
2. Psychology has a very poor record on replication, however the study below highlights the top 10 replicated findings from behavioural genetics. I recommend reading the entire thing, but the conclusion has a particularly interesting passage:“What we like best about some of these findings is that they are counterintuitive. For example, who would have thought that the heritability of intelligence increases throughout development (_Finding 5_) or that environmental measures show genetic influence (_Finding 7_) or that the abnormal is normal (_Finding 10_)? Another feature of these findings is that each is falsifiable.” https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4739500/ 
3. An excellent summary of recent longevity research, with a handy list of behaviours and compounds to improve it, including a great pretext to drink a lot of coffee! https://milkyeggs.com/biology/lifespan-extension-separating-fact-from-fiction/
