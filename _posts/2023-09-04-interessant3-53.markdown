I will endeavour to send this newsletter out on Monday evenings (GMT) going forward.

1. “Tribalism, i.e. the emphasis on the supreme importance of the tribe without which the individual is nothing at all, is an element which we shall find in many forms of historicist theories.” - K. PopperHistoricism is the belief that history develops according to certain principles or rules towards a specific end. Proponents of historicism argue that if one understands the laws or mechanisms driving this historical process, one can predict the future course of historical events. Well-known figures who are often considered to have historicist elements in their thought include Hegel, Marx, and Spengler (fascist ideologue), among others. I would add that many of the more modern theories of Critical Social Justice, which are largely collectivistic, build on historicist ideas and predictably display tribalism.
2. In this Marginal Revolution post,[Alex Tabarrok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Tabarrok) shares a study showing that greater access to firearms among black Americans reduced the rate of lynching in the southern states during the Jim Crow era. A very interesting nuance for the debate on gun rights, and he rightly points out that this is rarely mentioned.

3. Researchers use 12,000 cuneiform tablets containing business letters, all from between 1930 and 1775 B.C, to cleverly uncover the locations of ancient cities in Turkey. This is an example of the “Gravity Model of Trade” in action. ![Image](/assets/images/substack/136697348-298b3d83.webp)[https://twitter.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1695513196625326451?s=20](https://twitter.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1695513196625326451?s=20)
