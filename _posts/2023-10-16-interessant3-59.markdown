1.  **Surf Localism and Cultural Norms** : Surfing may seem like a laid-back sport, but when it comes to wave access, things can get quite serious. A fascinating study focuses on the concept of "surf localism," where riders use intimidation or even the threat of violence to monopolise waves. However, many surf communities use a "surfer's code" to self-regulate and avoid conflict. Intriguingly, the study—based on data from over 700 surf spots along the European Atlantic coast—finds that informal cultural norms significantly reduce the probability of violent exclusion. This underscores the power of community cooperation in managing shared resources without the need for formal state intervention. Dive deeper into the social dynamics of surfing [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11127-021-00929-3). ![Vintage Locals Only Metal Sign 2 12 x 18 Inches](/assets/images/substack/138023604-2ba99e6d.webp)
