1.  **A Breakthrough in Nuclear Disarmament Technology**  
An innovative approach proposes the remote and unilateral disablement of all nuclear bombs on Earth. Utilizing a 1000 TeV muon-\>neutrino beam, this method can penetrate the Earth to decay near fissile materials, rendering them ineffective. This groundbreaking research opens a new chapter in arms control, potentially revolutionising the path to global disarmament. ![Image](/assets/images/substack/141730305-e19a19ec.webp)
