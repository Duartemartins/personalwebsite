I have not recently been able to prioritise the newsletter as I would have wished, my apologies. The next two issues will be double issues to make up for this.

1.  **A Century-Old Milestone: UK's Emissions Hit Historic Low** In an unprecedented environmental milestone, UK emissions have plummeted to levels not seen since 1879, as highlighted in a new analysis by Carbon Brief. This significant reduction reflects the UK's committed efforts in combating climate change, transitioning towards renewable energy, and enhancing sustainability measures. The findings provide a beacon of hope and a model for other nations striving for a greener future.[Read more about this environmental breakthrough.](https://x.com/DrSimEvans/status/1767222825700425863?s=20) ![Image](/assets/images/substack/142616738-2e711fe9.webp)
2.  **Rawls' Original Position: A Foundation of Political Philosophy** The _original position_ is a key concept in John Rawls' theory of justice, where individuals choose societal principles from behind a "veil of ignorance," unaware of their own societal status. He argued it implied a strategy of maximin, a term taken from game theory that means maximising the welfare of the least advantaged. On the other hand, empirical studies show that most people value a maximised expected utility with a minimum welfare floor, which is in line with criticisms previously made by economists.You can read more about this [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_position), [here](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/original-position/), and for a well-known critique, [here](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nozick-political/).

1.  **The Tense Prelude: Macron-Putin Call Days Before Ukraine Invasion** Experience the intense atmosphere of the final telephone conversation between French President Emmanuel Macron and Russian President Vladimir Putin, just four days before the invasion of Ukraine. This dialogue reveals the profound sense of delusion harboured by Putin regarding the situation in Ukraine, how manipulative he is, and in my opinion shows that Macron is one of the best statesmen in the world.[Listen to the crucial Macron-Putin conversation.](https://x.com/spooked75/status/1767787253831495773?s=20)
