# The Micro-SaaS Canon: Essential Resources for Indie Hackers

In recent years, the world of software-as-a-service (SaaS) has seen a surge in smaller, more focused products known as micro-SaaS. These ventures, often run by solo entrepreneurs or small teams, have captured the imagination of many aspiring indie hackers. This article aims to compile some of the most influential resources in the micro-SaaS and indie hacking space.

## The Micro-SaaS Landscape

Micro-SaaS refers to SaaS businesses that are typically:

- Narrow in scope
- Operated by a small team (often just one person)
- Aiming for profitability with low overhead
- Not seeking venture funding

These ventures offer an attractive alternative to the traditional startup model, allowing entrepreneurs to build sustainable businesses without the need for venture capital or large teams.
