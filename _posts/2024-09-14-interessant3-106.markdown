### ** Feminisation Has Consequences**

This _fascinating_ series of essays, part of ’s ongoing exploration of modern societal shifts, describes the evolutionary-psychological evidence demonstrating that men and women are not just physically different but also cognitively distinct. These differences influence social dynamics and policy, challenging the idea of erasing traditional sex roles. As societies prosper and evolve, innate biological factors become more pronounced, affecting how we interact and the systems we create. The author emphasises that pushing male standards as benchmarks for women may undermine female flourishing, especially in the context of motherhood and happiness. I learnt a lot from these essays, highly recommended.

### ** Spain’s Genetic Tapestry: Tracing Ancient Lineages**

A fascinating genetic map of Spain reveals that modern Spaniards, particularly in the south, share a stronger genetic link with pre-Roman Celtic populations than with the later Roman or Berber invaders. One can actually make out the the historical kingdoms of Galicia, León, Castille, Aragon, Valencia, Basque Country, and Catalonia, showing the deep influence of the northern populations that reconquered the Iberian Peninsula during the Reconquista. Despite centuries of migration and conquest, the northern genetic legacy endures, painting a complex picture of Spain’s historical and genetic landscape.
