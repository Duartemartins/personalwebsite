title: "Take Action: The Draghi Report Brings Us One Step Closer to EU/ACC"
description: “After reading the Draghi Report, I discovered that 4 out of the 5 proposals in my EU/ACC open letter were included almost verbatim. While there’s still room for improvement, particularly on issues like common debt issuance, this is a promising step. Sign the open letter to help keep pressure on decision-makers and continue driving progress in Europe.”

I finally got round to reading the Draghi report, and to my surprise, 4 out of the 5 proposals from [my EU/ACC article](https://www.santiago-martins.com/european-accelerationism-eu-acc.html) were reflected in the report, almost word-for-word. It’s both validating and encouraging to see such alignment. I don't wish to presume, but if someone reading this was involved in drafting the Draghi report, I would love to know if the team came across my blog post—please get in touch.  

There are of course elements in the report I take issue with, it would be weird if there weren't given that it's 400 pages long. The push for more common debt issuance and dirigisme worries me, particularly for countries on Europe’s periphery, like my own, that could suffer from Dutch Disease—an over-reliance on inflows of external capital at the expense of long-term competitiveness. By centralising too much control and issuing more shared debt, we risk deepening these imbalances rather than alleviating them. Despite these concerns, I believe the bulk of the report is full of excellent ideas that push in the right direction. Europe needs more contributions like this to keep momentum going. 

**So, where do we go from here?** How do we continue to accelerate European progress? It's evident the EU is listening, as are national governments, but we must do more. It’s up to us to keep the pressure on politicians to deliver on these proposals. The report’s due process may be questionable, but what’s undeniable is that the conversation is happening at the highest levels.  

At the core of driving European progress lies the role of its citizens. It’s not enough for technocrats and policymakers to lead the charge; real change requires the active participation of the people. Citizens must be more than just passive observers—they should be advocates for the policies that shape their future. By fostering an inclusive and democratic process, we ensure that the EU reflects the needs and aspirations of its diverse population.  

**I urge you to consider signing** [my EU/ACC open letter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jF_d49euri9a-c_kGd5G-hrniNoQeJtkiIeBii_ir5A/edit)**.** So far, I’ve received over 20 signatures from scientists, CEOs, founders, and policymakers who are united in support. However, to make a stronger impact, I aim to gather at least 200 signatures. This would send a clear message to decision-makers that these policies have widespread backing and are essential for driving European progress. I understand that signing a letter from someone online you don't know can feel like a big ask—this can naturally bring some hesitation or questions. If you have any concerns or need more context, I’d be happy to answer any questions and provide further details. 

The time for action is now. By coming together and making our views known, we can ensure that policymakers respond with urgency. Let’s make sure they hear us loud and clear.
