### ** Ubi Sunt: A Reflection on Time and Loss**

The phrase _ubi sunt_, meaning “where are they?” in Latin, has been used for centuries to express longing for things, people, or times that have passed. This concept appears in literature, philosophy, and poetry, capturing humanity’s fascination with the impermanence of life.

The Wikipedia article shows how _ubi sunt_ questions have appeared in medieval works like _Beowulf_ and _The Wanderer_ and how the theme carries into modern culture. Whether reflecting on mortality or lamenting the fleeting nature of youth, _ubi sunt_ resonates as a timeless meditation on change and loss.
