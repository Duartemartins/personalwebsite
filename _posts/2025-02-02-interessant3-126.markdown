### ** From Groupon to Supersonic: The Bold Journey of Boom**

How does a product manager from a coupon company end up building a supersonic jet? Blake Scholl’s story is a masterclass in first-principles thinking, perseverance, and daring to challenge industry norms. This fascinating thread traces his journey—leaving a stagnant tech job, self-teaching aerospace engineering, and convincing investors that supersonic travel is viable once again. With $25B in pre-orders, Boom Supersonic is making history.

### ** The Trust-Diversity Paradox: Is the Debate Overblown?**

Does diversity erode trust? As we shared [last week](https://interessant3.substack.com/p/interessant3-125?r=7n4bs), Robert Putnam’s research suggests a strong link, however economist argues the effect is vastly overstated. His analysis of Putnam’s data reveals that factors like home ownership, crime rates, and commuting times have a far greater impact on trust than diversity. If true, the policy focus should shift away from diversity debates and towards structural reforms that actually improve social cohesion.

### ** Why So Many Buildings in Africa Are Left Unfinished**

Across Africa, skeletal high-rises and half-built homes are a common sight. The reasons are complex: weak property rights, economic instability, and a “build-as-you-can-afford” mindset. Unlike in the West, where developers rely on mortgages and large-scale financing, many African builders fund projects in small, incremental steps—leading to long, uncertain timelines. Personally, I always assumed the reason was simply poverty, and not primarily a consequence of poor property rights and lack of debt financing.
