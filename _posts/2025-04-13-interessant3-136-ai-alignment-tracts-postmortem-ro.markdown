###  **Building a Safer Future: AI Risk, Alignment, and You**

The Centre for AI Safety offers a free, no-jargon introduction to the biggest questions in the field: how can we ensure increasingly powerful AI systems remain aligned with human values? Designed for the curious, not necessarily the code-savvy, this course lays the foundation for understanding catastrophic risk, governance, and what it means to steer transformative AI wisely. No prerequisites, just ambition and access to a 4,000 strong global community of learners and builders.

> The AI Alignment course is designed to introduce the key concepts in AI safety and alignment, and will give you space to engage with, evaluate and debate these ideas.

###  **A Planning Dream Deferred: The Tract Postmortem**

Tract set out to hack the UK housing crisis by streamlining planning permission with software. They built tools for land analysis, AI powered document drafting, and even explored becoming land promoters themselves. But after two years, no revenue, and a conservative market that resisted change, they returned the capital and wrote one of the most incisive postmortems in recent memory. A masterclass in founder self awareness and how good tech can flounder in bad markets.

###  **The Roganverse: Power, Podcasts, and the Comedy Club That Changed Austin**

Joe Rogan didn’t just move to Austin, he remade it. Helen Lewis’s Atlantic profile captures how Rogan’s Comedy Mothership became ground zero for a new cultural bloc: tech bros, heterodox thinkers, wellness gurus, and disaffected liberals orbiting the podcaster turned kingmaker. At once bawdy and philosophical, reactionary and progressive, Rogan’s influence shapes the political and social mood of an entire city.
