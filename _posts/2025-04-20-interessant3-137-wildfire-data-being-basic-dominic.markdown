###  **Where the World Actually Burns**

Wildfires make global headlines, but only in certain places - Portugal, The USA, Greece, or Canada are typical examples. The data tells a different story. Over half of the world’s burned area each year is in Africa - in some years, close to two-thirds. These fires shape the global average, yet they’re almost entirely absent from media coverage. If we’re to tackle this issue, we need to prioritise our efforts. Two overlooked stories reveal how misaligned our attention has become:

1. **Brazil's deteriorating forest fire crisis under President Lula** has escaped international scrutiny despite [worsening conditions](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanam/article/PIIS2667-193X(24)00240-0/fulltext). For years fires in Brazil made headlines for political reasons, despite being around the average expected.
2. **Africa's quiet progress over two decades** offers a counternarrative of cautious optimism: a success story of steady improvement virtually unknown to global audiences. For perspective, the annual reduction in burned area in Africa compared to 20 years ago equals what North America experiences in five years of forest fires, eliminated every single year.

If we aim to address global wildfires, our resources and attention must align with where fires actually burn, not just where they make headlines.

![A bar graph illustrating the share of global area burned by wildfires across different regions from 2012 to 2024. The graph is divided vertically into segments representing five regions: Africa, Europe, Asia, Oceania, and North and South America. The deep red color represents Africa, which dominates the graph, showing more than half of the total area burned. Other regions, represented by lighter colors, fill the remaining sections of the graph. The year labels are placed along the horizontal axis, indicating the timeline of the data. The title emphasizes that more than half of the area burned by wildfire is in Africa. The data source is the Global Wildfire Information System, with the year of the data being noted as 2025.

###  **The Case for Being Basic**

Nadia Asparouhova writes about what it’s like to live inside the idea economy - where thinking is currency and everyone’s expected to have a take. “Being basic” becomes her coping mechanism, a conscious rejection of intellectual performance in favour of simplicity, quiet, even boredom. It’s a sharp, slow-burn essay that turns the culture of constant output on its head.

###  **Cummings Unfiltered**

The controversial but always interesting Dominic Cummings makes a rare long-form appearance on the Dwarkesh Podcast, ranging across broken government, civil service dysfunction, existential risks, and war gaming AI futures. From Taiwan and Russia to Bismarck and Lee Kuan Yew, it’s sharp, chaotic, and gripping.
