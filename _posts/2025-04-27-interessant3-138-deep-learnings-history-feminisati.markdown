Oxbridge-educated AI researcher Richard Ngo maps the evolution of deep learning. Scaling simple algorithms with brute-force compute, not necessarily new theory, drove AI from blurry images to fluent language models and game masters. The speed of it all? Even the builders didn’t see it coming.

Striking examples are the historic American gender divides in stances on Nuclear power, GMOs, and housebuilding, all banners of the Progress Studies movement, where women mostly disapprove and men mostly approve. An interesting thesis that deserves to be scrutinised.
