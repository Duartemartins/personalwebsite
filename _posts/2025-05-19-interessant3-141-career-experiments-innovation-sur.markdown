Experimenting with a different format this time, let me know what you think of it:

### **1. Tim Urban, “How to Pick a Career (That Actually Fits You)”**

- **Conventional wisdom isn’t your friend** : society hands down outdated “career-tunnel” advice; your task is to become CEO of your own path.
- **The framework** : map a _Want Box_ (authentic yearnings) against a _Reality Box_ (what’s actually attainable). Their overlap, the _Option Pool_,is where viable choices live.
- **Diagnose motivations** : the “Yearning Octopus” exposes conflicting drives and fears, helping you clean noise out of the Want Box.
- **Judge feasibility with maths** : _Progress = Pace × Persistence_. Talent, chef-like first-principles thinking, focus and stamina combine to shrink the distance to any “success star”.
- **Think in dots, not tunnels** : modern careers are a string of experiments; choose the next dot, test the hypothesis, and pivot when evidence or personal growth demands. Contentment comes from running the best experiment you can today, not from predicting dot #4.

### **2. William D. Nordhaus (NBER Digest, Oct 2004), “Who Gains from Innovation?”**

- **Schumpeterian profits are surprisingly small** : across 1948-2001, firms captured only about **2.2 %** of the total social surplus generated by US innovation; consumers absorbed the rest through lower prices.
- **Appropriability differs by sector** : patents and strong property rights (e.g. pharmaceuticals) let producers keep a larger slice; public-domain knowledge (e.g. weather forecasting) drives prices down instead.
- **A simple model** links surplus capture to three parameters: innovation-driven TFP growth, the instantaneous appropriability ratio and profit-depreciation, showing that even fast technical change needn’t translate into high profits.
- **Dot-com lesson** : investors in the late-1990s “New Economy” implicitly assumed appropriability near 90 %; Nordhaus’s estimates (~7 %) imply innovators could net $0.4 trn, not the $6 trn baked into market valuations, helping explain the bubble.
- **Macro angle** : productivity-driven wealth effects raise consumption, but only about one-third as much as they lift potential output, the so-called _Greenspan effect_.

### **3. Golden Mean (Philosophy)**

- **Core idea** : virtue lies in the mean between excess and deficiency; the Delphic maxim _mēden agan_ (“nothing in excess”) anticipates Aristotle’s treatment in _Nicomachean Ethics_.
- **Classical examples** : courage mediates between cowardice and recklessness; political balance blends monarchy, aristocracy and democracy.
- **Cross-cultural echoes** : the Buddhist Middle Way, Confucian _Zhongyong_, Jewish _Musar_ literature and Islamic, Hindu and Christian moral teachings all promote moderated conduct.
- **Narratives of moderation** : myths like Daedalus warning Icarus to “fly the middle course” reinforce the danger of extremes.
- **Modern relevance** : the principle underpins contemporary virtue ethics, behavioural nudging toward balanced living and political theories favouring mixed constitutions over dogmatic ideologies.
