The posts for June will be released over the next couple days, with regular programming resuming from Sunday onwards.

### 1. Archie Hall – “Reflections on Britain’s Triage Ward”

-  A botched dog-theft case exposes the UK’s broken emergency response, with police unable or unwilling to coordinate basic inter-county action.
-  Hall builds from this personal story to a broader diagnosis of Britain’s slow civic unraveling, describing a "triage-ward state" that only reacts to the direst crises.
-  Charts reveal post-Covid stagnation in everything from ambulance wait times to driving-test backlogs, with the "Covid hump" never reversed.
-  Systemic dysfunction arises from layered failures: overloaded hospitals trap police officers, while broken IT systems block basic cooperation.
-  The conclusion is bleak but clear-eyed: the British state is brittle, overstretched, and stuck in reactive mode. Bold, imaginative reform is long overdue.

### 2. CERN – “ALICE Detects Conversion of Lead into Gold at the LHC”

-  At CERN’s ALICE experiment, lead nuclei colliding at near light speeds have been shown to eject protons in just the right quantities to momentarily form gold.
-  This occurs during "ultra-peripheral" collisions, near misses that create brief but enormous electromagnetic fields, triggering nuclear reshuffling.
-  Detectors captured these events by counting tiny variations in emitted particles, distinguishing between outcomes like thallium, mercury, and gold.
- ⏱ Run 2 of the LHC yielded about 29 picograms of gold, enough to make headlines but not jewellery.
-  More than a validation of alchemy, this helps physicists model nuclear fragmentation and improve predictions about beam loss in particle colliders.

In the electromagnetic dissociation process, a photon interacting with a nucleus can excite oscillations of its internal structure and result in the ejection of small numbers of neutrons (two) and protons (three), leaving the gold (203Au) nucleus behind (Image: CERN)](/assets/images/substack/166392985-48806ab3.webp)

### 3. Charles I. Jones – Curriculum Vitae

- ‍ Stanford economist Chad Jones has quietly built one of the most compelling bodies of work in macroeconomics, focused on how innovation fuels long run growth.
-  If you’ve ever wondered _Why do economies grow in the long run?_ or why the richest countries today are vastly wealthier than 100 years ago, Jones’s papers are the best place to start.
-  His 2016 piece _"The Facts of Economic Growth"_ serves as an encyclopaedia of empirical truths in the field, laying out growth patterns, productivity gaps, and open questions with clarity and depth.
-  He raises fundamental challenges: How do institutions evolve? How do ideas spread across borders? Can we quantify the value of knowledge spillovers or the global impact of rising talent in countries like China?
-  Recent papers tackle AI’s existential risk, top income inequality, and the future of population and welfare, always with a focus on the intersection of data, theory, and long term thinking.
