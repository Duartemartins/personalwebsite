The posts for June will be released over the next couple days, with regular programming resuming from Sunday onwards.

### **1. David Rozado – “The Strange Behaviour of LLMs in Hiring Decisions”**

-  _30 k+ résumé face-offs_ – Across **30,800** A/B picks (22 models × 70 jobs), frontier LLMs chose the female-named CV **56.9 %** of the time (Cohen’s _h_ = 0.28).
-  _More cues, more skew_ – Adding an explicit **Gender: Female** field nudged preference to **58.9 % / 41.1 %** , showing models amplify whatever demographic hints they see.
-  _Masking flop_ – Re-labelling applicants “Candidate A/B” merely shifted bias to whichever label appeared **first** (63.5 % vs 36.5 %); only counter-balancing the labels restored parity.
-  _Gender concordant preferred pronouns_ – Listing _she/her_ or _he/him_ edged selections up (53 % vs 47 %), yet the tilt toward women persisted.
- ‍ _Human-in-the-loop a must_ – Model size or “reasoning” mode didn’t curb bias; vendors’ “bias-free AI hiring” claims look premature. !

### **2. Payton J. Jones** _ **et al.** _ **– “Helping or Harming? Trigger Warnings and Trauma Histories”**

-  _No calming power_ – In 451 trauma survivors, trigger warnings failed to reduce anxiety; Bayes factors back “no benefit”.
-  _Identity magnifier_ – Warnings boosted “trauma centrality”, a variable correlated with worse PTSD outcomes.
-  _Severe cases, worse outcome_ – Readers above the clinical PCL-5 cut-off actually felt **more** anxious after a warning.
-  _Avoidance myth_ – Only 0.3 % quit early, identical to controls; warnings didn’t enable safe disengagement.
-  _Long-form still untested_ – Evidence does not yet justify routine classroom deployment.

### **3. John C. Baez & Mike Stay – “Physics, Topology, Logic and Computation: A Rosetta Stone”**

This widely-cited expository work by **John C. Baez** (a mathematical physicist known for work on quantum gravity and higher category theory) and **Mike Stay** (a computer scientist with a focus on theoretical models of computation) was first posted to arXiv in 2009 and later published in Springer’s _Lecture Notes in Physics_. It provides a conceptual “Rosetta Stone” to unify four major disciplines: physics, topology, logic, and computer science, by showing how they can all be described using the same abstract structures from **category theory**. If you’ve ever wished you could translate between Feynman diagrams, logical proofs, and computer programs (a common thought, I’m sure), this is the bridge.

-  _One syntax for four sciences_ – A **closed symmetric monoidal category** (think of a Lego-style rulebook for gluing systems) treats **objects** (physical systems, manifolds, propositions, data types) and **morphisms** (processes, cobordisms, proofs, programs) in one algebraic language.
-  _Feynman diagrams re-imagined_ – In **string diagrams** every wire is an object and every node a morphism; a quantum **linear operator** and a topological **cobordism** (spacetime surface joining spaces) are literally the same picture read two ways.
-  _Curry-Howard goes quantum_ – The classic **Curry-Howard correspondence** (“proofs ≙ programs”) extends to these diagrams, aligning logical deduction with circuit-style computation; 1990s quantum-crypto work pushed the merger.
-  _Toward a general science of processes_ – Elevating to **n-categories** (morphisms-between-morphisms, and so on) promises a single calculus for braiding anyons, orchestrating workflows, or describing self-modifying code.
-  _Rosetta Stone table_ – Their pocket chart distils the translation: **process → proof → program** ; once you read it, jargon walls across the four fields become clearer. !
