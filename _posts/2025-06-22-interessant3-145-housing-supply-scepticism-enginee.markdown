The posts for June will be released over the next couple days, with regular programming resuming from Sunday onwards.

### **1. Supply Scepticism: Housing Supply and Affordability**

-  _The phenomenon_: Supply scepticism is the belief, held by a very large number of activists, renters, and community members, that adding more market-rate housing doesn’t help affordability and may actually raise prices. This coalition increasingly blocks housing proposals, joining forces with traditional NIMBY resistance.
-  Both economic theory and real-world data show increasing supply _does_ moderate price growth, even in tight urban markets. Limiting supply reduces economic productivity, imposes environmental costs, and exacerbates inequality.
-  _Sceptic argument 1_: Land is scarce, so it should be used only for affordable housing. _Counter_: Land can be used more intensively by allowing for more dense housing, and market-rate projects often include affordable units through inclusionary policies.
-  _Sceptic argument 2_: New supply is all luxury, and won’t benefit the poor. _Counter_: Supply in one segment relieves pressure elsewhere. _Filtering down_ is real, it’s how much of the affordable rental stock historically emerges. !
-  _Sceptic argument 3_: More supply induces more demand. _Counter_: Housing demand isn’t “infinitely elastic”. Unlike motorways, housing is a rivalrous and excludable good: Only one household occupies a home, so the extra unit does not diminish the usefulness of neighbouring homes. Added supply still lowers pressure on prices, even if some new demand follows.
-  _Sceptic argument 4_: New buildings raise local rents through gentrification. _Counter_: Evidence is mixed, but blocking development often _increases_ displacement risk by tightening supply further.

### **2. Intriguing Engineering Feats for 2025**

 A global snapshot of real-world tech launches: rockets, robotaxis, AI memory, and more. Highlights:

-  _MethaneSAT_ will soon make high-resolution emissions data public, offering transparency and climate accountability on a new scale.
-  The U.S. begins vitrifying Cold War-era nuclear waste at Hanford, turning radioactive sludge into stable glass blocks.
-  Airhart’s _Sling_ aircraft promises a one-hour training path to flight, though the $500k price tag will clip most wings.
-  India’s _Agri Stack_ aims to revolutionise farm data integration for 60M small-scale farmers, streamlining aid and disaster response.
-  Baidu expects its _Apollo Go_ robotaxi fleet to become the world’s first profitable autonomous taxi network, by slashing vehicle production costs to just $28k.

-  High-bandwidth memory (HBM4) will power next-gen AI, while high-NA EUV chipmaking may extend Moore’s Law into late 2020s.

### **3. Asperholm et al. – Living Conditions and Psychological Sex Differences**

 A meta-meta-analysis on how wealth and equality shape psychological sex differences, sometimes counterintuitively.

-  Reviews 54 studies and performs new analyses on 27 large datasets, linking national conditions to sex differences in traits and cognition.
-  Finds that **sex differences in personality, negative emotion, and episodic memory are** _ **larger** _ **in countries with higher living standards**.
-  In contrast, differences in sexual behaviour, partner preferences, and maths ability are _smaller_ in these same countries.
-  Economic indicators (like GDP) were more predictive than gender-equality metrics, raising questions about the “equality = similarity” assumption.
-  Suggests a nuanced “gender-equality paradox”: societal development may amplify certain psychological sex differences rather than erase them.
