**1. Fergus McCullough – How Spain Builds Beautiful New Neighbourhoods**

-  Spain’s cities thrive thanks to _land readjustment_, a legal mechanism that reorganises fragmented land plots for coherent urban development.
-  Landowners contribute their irregular plots, surrender a portion for infrastructure, and receive back better-located parcels in a newly planned layout.

-  Initially slow and fraught, the process gained traction when Valencia introduced _compulsory readjustment_ in 1994, backing up planning agents with legal teeth.
- ⏱ Reforms slashed plan approval times from years to months and quintupled annual development sites within three years.
-  The result: high-impact projects like Zorrotzaurre in Bilbao and Camino Hondo del Grao, where messy land was turned into liveable city space.

**2. Nick van Osdol – Stormfury: Geoengineering’s Past and Future**

-  _Project Stormfury_ (1962–1983) tried to weaken hurricanes with cloud seeding, it was ambitious, dangerous, and ultimately inconclusive.
-  Today, geoengineering spans many methods: from stratospheric aerosols and direct air capture to methane oxidation and marine cloud brightening.
-  Many could slow warming quickly, especially _solar radiation management_ techniques, though most remain early-stage and ethically thorny. !
-  Humanity already geoengineers (via emissions and land use); the question is whether we now do it _intentionally_ and _reversibly_.
-  The core argument: we need to research and prepare now, even if we never deploy these tools at scale.

**3. Alexei Alexandrov & Laurie Goodman – Place the Blame Where It Belongs**

I’ve been reading up on housing policy and social attitudes lately, and I’m increasingly convinced it’s the single most important issue facing western democracies at present. This paper addresses common misconceptions.

-  _Scapegoat 1:_ Targeted federal mortgage-access programmes inflate house prices and rents. Reality: Such initiatives mostly convert renters into owners rather than creating extra households, so overall demand is unchanged and price pressure reflects inadequate supply, not credit tweaks.
-  _Scapegoat 2_: Developers who focus on high-end projects drive the affordability crisis. Reality: Every additional dwelling enlarges the housing stock; even luxury units free up cheaper homes through filtering, so more construction, especially mid-priced, tempers price growth.

-  _Scapegoat 3:_ Institutional investors buying single-family homes force prices and rents upward. Reality: Investors follow, rather than create, excess demand; rising costs stem from tight supply plus household formation, not fund ownership.
-  _Scapegoat 4:_ Political resistance to relaxing zoning rules is the sole culprit behind high housing costs. Reality: Restrictive zoning does constrain construction, yet a national supply strategy is essential for cost-effective, large-scale building.
