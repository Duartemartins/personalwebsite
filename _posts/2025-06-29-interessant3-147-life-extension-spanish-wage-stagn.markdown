**1.**  **: “Biotech must be accelerated to lengthen human life”**

-  Twentieth-century gains came from scrubbing out “extrinsic” killers such as sanitation, vaccines and safer roads, but that well is now dry.
-  Each extra year of life today needs about 2.5× the all-cause-mortality cut that was required in 1900, so old tactics deliver ever-smaller returns.
-  Caloric-restriction hype works for short-lived, metabolically fragile species yet does nothing for long-lived models, so extension is not the same as normalisation.
-  Heart-disease care highlights the bind: fewer die of acute infarctions, more survive to chronic failure, and existing drugs only nudge the curve.
-  Conclusion: only rapid biotech innovation such as gene editing, senolytics and organoid repair can push the survival curve rightwards, with patents and slow trials acting as choke-points.

**2. Spanish Wage Stagnation**

Spain is going through a political crisis at the moment, however a perhaps even more worrying trend is that its wages have essentially stagnated in the past 30 years.

-  Eurostat data expose stark divergence in employee wages: Ireland rockets (+64 % to +72 %) while Italy (-2 % to +3 %) and Spain (+3 % to +6 %) stall.
-  Structural culprits include low productivity growth, rigid sectoral bargaining and slow judicial processes in the laggards.
-  Northern Europe such as Denmark and Sweden shows steady, broad-based wage growth without boom-bust drama.

**3. Pierre de Wulf, “10 Time- and Money-Saving Tips for Indie-Hackers”**

Pierre de Wulf is the founder of ScrapingBee, which he bootstrapped to 5 million USD ARR and exited for eight figures. He shares a playbook to help others on the same journey save time and money. A few highlights below.

-  Need an idea? Scan Capterra or G2 one-star reviews and build the fix.
-  One-minute MVP: drop a fake UI screenshot into niche LinkedIn groups and measure interest.
-  Netlify 15-second deploy plus AWS credit bundles cut infrastructure costs to near zero.
-  Offer 10× what your free plan offers for a 15-minute call to collect feedback.
