**1. Konstantin A. Kholodilin – “Rent control effects through the lens of empirical research: An almost complete review of the literature”**

-  **Scope check:** Surveys almost every empirical study since WWII, spanning 80 years, 30+ countries and every major rent-control episode.
-  **Consensus pattern:** Strong evidence that controls cap in-place rents short-term but shrink the controlled stock and distort new construction. ![Image](/assets/images/substack/168812903-6e8772c0.jpeg)
-  **Equity twist:** Benefits flow mainly to long-term tenants with higher socio-economic status, often crowding out newer or poorer entrants.
-  **Collateral damage:** Strong consensus on lower new-build activity, poorer maintenance, and stickier tenant mobility - undermining long-run welfare gains.

1. **GiveWell Podcast Ep. 6 – “Forecasting the Future of Global Health Funding”**

-  **Funding forecast:** GiveWell expects a 50 % cut in US global-health aid and a 35 % drop worldwide, opening a US $20 bn annual gap.
-  **Model mechanics:** Blends macro growth scenarios with expert-elicited probabilities to stress-test disease-programme budgets.
-  **Programme risk:** Even top-value interventions (e.g. malaria nets, HIV treatment, child vaccinations) could lose US $3 bn a year.
-  **Action plan:** GiveWell is ramping research capacity and courting new donors to fast-fill the most cost-effective gaps.

**3.Giuseppe Gabrielli et al. – “Does Twitter Data Mirror the European North–South Family Ties Divide?”**

-  **Big-data lens:** Analyses 3 million geolocated tweets mentioning family terms, 2020-2023, across 25 European states.
-  **North-South gap:** Southern users tweet family references 40 % more often, echoing survey evidence of tighter kin networks.
-  **Digital ≠ physical?:** Migrants in the North keep southern tweeting habits, hinting that online talk preserves homeland attachment.
-  **Method note:** Demonstrates that language-filtered hashtags rival traditional surveys for rapid, low-cost sociological monitoring.
