**1. Richard M. Stallman – “The JavaScript Trap”**

-  Many sites unknowingly load proprietary JavaScript into users’ browsers, undermining software freedom even on ostensibly “free” pages.
-  Because the code executes locally, it bypasses normal scrutiny; users run non-audited programs without consent, recreating the very lock-in that free software avoids.
-  Open-source activist Stallman proposes automatic rejection (or substitution) of non-free scripts via tools like LibreJS and urges developers to serve JS under proper free licences.
-  The essay reframes browser scripting as a locus of user autonomy, arguing that true web openness demands source-available, modifiable scripts.

1. **Kyle Nolan – “We Reached $1 M ARR with Zero Funding” (ProjectionLab)**
  -  Built a personal-finance simulation app solo, deliberately shunning VC money to retain product focus and creative control.
  -  Growth came from relentless customer feedback loops: weekly changelogs, transparent road-maps, and a vibrant subreddit community.
  -  Revenue strategy mixed freemium tiers, annual plans, and a healthy upsell to lifetime licences to smooth cash flow. ![Page hero image](/assets/images/substack/168815161-f334db22.webp)
  -  Key lesson: modest pricing + obsessive polish can out-compete louder, better-funded rivals—proof that patience still pays on the indie SaaS path.

1. **– “Free-Market Economics Is Working Surprisingly Well”**

-  Argentina’s Javier Milei defied critics by slashing a 31 % spending gap - monthly inflation fell from hyper levels to ~2.4 %, with GDP rebounding 5.8 %.
-  Deregulation (rent control repeal, labour-market flexibility) sparked supply surges and dropping rents, challenging fears of social implosion.

> In truth, Milei is hardly the only example of neoliberal success in recent years. Although China is nominally communist and now engages in a lot of industrial policy, from the 1980s through the early 2000s its approach was [almost entirely](https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/confs/2016/pdf/rba-conference-volume-2016-lardy.pdf) one of [privatization](https://ucigcc.org/publication/the-rise-of-chinas-industrial-policy-1978-to-2020/). [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_liberalisation_in_India) got a big growth expansion from liberalization in the 1990s and 2000s, as did [Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%90%E1%BB%95i_M%E1%BB%9Bi). Poland’s [development miracle](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/25/poland-change-europe-high-achievers-country) is largely a neoliberal one — its industrial policy has focused mostly on simply [promoting foreign direct investment](https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-polandmalaysia-model), while its other policies have simply been a mix of institutional improvements and free trade.

-  Smith argues policy efficacy is path-dependent: nations oscillate between state and market fixes; neither camp owns a permanent mandate.
-  The broader takeaway: mixed economies thrive when leaders correct excess - not when they idolise a single ideology. Evolution beats revolution.
