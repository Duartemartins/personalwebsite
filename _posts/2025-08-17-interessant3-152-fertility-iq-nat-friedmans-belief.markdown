1. **International meta-analysis of the relationship between fertility and intelligence**

-  The study draws on 610 datasets (n ≈ 1.2m) to test whether people with higher or lower intelligence have more children across 65 countries.
-  Results suggest global IQ is declining by ~1.1 points per decade to 2100, with about one-third of the decline happening _within_ countries.
-  Patterns differ: strongest negative IQ–fertility link in Latin America, Iran, and Turkey; weakest (near zero) in Scandinavia and Switzerland.
-  Authors caution that poor data quality in some countries tempers confidence—measurement issues may blur real differences.
-  National IQ correlates moderately with fertility differentials (r = .51), linking societal development to demographic selection. !

1. **Nat Friedman - Some Things I Believe**

-  Friedman (former GitHub CEO, now AI investor) sets out a philosophy of speed, ambition, and intellectual independence.
-  Core stance: technology is humanity’s lever to reshape the universe, and progress depends on moving fast and pursuing big ideas.
-  He rejects the efficient market hypothesis as misleading, suggesting opportunity lies where consensus fails.
-  Culture: fewer, sharper teams; empower great individuals; accept mistakes if they yield “uncorrelated excellence.”
-  A recurring theme is dopamine: true builders derive motivation from improving ideas and creating impact, not external validation.

1. **Barney Hussey-Yeo —Sharing Startup Pitch Decks (2016–2022)**

-  The Cleo founder published all his fundraising decks, from a modest £600k seed (2016) to an $80m Series C (2022).
-  Each deck reflects shifting investor climates: early enthusiasm at EF Demo Day, frictionless pre-emptions for Seed & Series A, and a gruelling Series B.
-  Series B highlights: even strong growth plus U.S. traction didn’t guarantee easy money- timing and narrative mattered.
-  His guiding principle across decks: build an AI agent that makes money work for ordinary people - big vision, clearly expressed.
