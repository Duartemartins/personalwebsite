1. **Lukas B. Freund & Lukas F. Mann - Job Transformation, Specialization, and the Labor Market Effects of AI**

-  The authors of this paper argue that AI’s biggest labour impact isn’t job destruction but **job transformation** - changing which tasks matter inside occupations.
-  Workers who excelled at now-automated tasks (like data entry or record processing) lose out, forced to move and typically take pay cuts.
-  But automation also **creates winners** : incumbents freed to spend more time on people-facing or coordination tasks see wage gains; meanwhile, “outsiders” who once lacked the right skills can now enter jobs where machines handle the hard parts.
-  Large Language Models (LLMs) trigger bigger shifts than past technologies such as industrial robots because they hit a wider spread of skills - making averages misleading and outcomes highly uneven.
-  The key message: “exposure” to AI doesn’t mean inevitable decline. It means turbulence - some sink, some rise - depending on how their **specialisation lines up with what machines take over**.

1. **- Peak Cinema**

-  Economist Scott Sumner claims the **true golden age of cinema** was 1958–63: the convergence of Hollywood perfection (Hitchcock, Wilder) and European avant-garde (Godard, Truffaut, Antonioni).
-  American, French, Japanese, and Italian auteurs all hit creative highs, yielding films like _Vertigo_, _8½_, and _Jules and Jim_.
-  He frames this through David Galenson’s idea of **experimental vs conceptual innovators** - late bloomers vs sudden disruptors - both peaking around 1960.
-  A personal aside explores how eras we lived through feel “normal,” while others recede into the unreal “history” category, highlighting generational perception gaps.
- Overall, this is a great list of films to watch!

1. **NASA - Your Name in Landsat**

-  Sharing a cool little tool: NASA lets anyone create their name from images in their Landsat archive that resemble letters.
