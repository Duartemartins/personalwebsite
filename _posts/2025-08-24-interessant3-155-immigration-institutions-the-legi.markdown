1. Garett Jones - Do Immigrants Import Their Economic Destiny?

-  **Thesis:** migrants transmit norms and institutional preferences; short-run effects are modest, but over decades they can tilt governance and prosperity.
-  **Deep Roots (SAT):** _migration-adjusted_ **S** tates, **A** griculture, **T** echnology scores predict today’s institutions, people carry advantages more than places do. For example:

> Australia has quite a low ancestral technology score: Aboriginal Australians used little of the world’s cutting edge technology in 1500 A.D. But since Australia is now overwhelmingly populated by the descendants of British migrants, Australia’s migration-adjusted technology score is currently quite high.

-  **Attitudes travel:** inherited trust, redistribution preferences, and familism persist; low trust in government leads to demand for regulation; putting family above moral action (“_familism”_) lowers civic participation and innovation.
-  **New Voters = New Policies:** enfranchisement evidence shows policy moves with new voters (e.g., social spending out of GDP increased by 0.6-1.2% in the short-run as a consequence of women’s suffrage, while the long-run effect is three to eight times larger).
-  **Diaspora case:** higher post-1500 Chinese migration shares in Asia correlate with greater economic freedom (Singapore/HK/Taiwan ≫ Laos/Myanmar), hinting at peaceful institutional drift.
-  **Policy read:** assimilation is two-way and exceptions exist, but if you must bet, high-SAT inflows are likelier to nudge institutions towards markets, liberalism, and prosperity over time.

1. B. Hauth - the legibility bottleneck

-  **Core bottleneck in making more innovative companies:** According to the author, it’s not capital, engineers, or ideas - it’s investors’ inability to _see_ genuine hard-tech competence, so they over-rely on brittle proxies (degrees, papers, PR).
-  **Credential decay:** once a number becomes the target, people game it; the metric stops reflecting substance (Goodhart’s Law in plain English).
- ‍ **The Musk workaround:** rare founders self-learn enough to do first-principles vetting and cull fools; the scarce role is the _illegibility interpreter_ between deep tech and money.
-  **Market symptoms:** credential inflation, “experience-only” funnels, ageism, drawn-out hiring, and H-1B usage for cost/control/count/caste, are signals of evaluation failure, not real talent scarcity.
-  **Bottom line:** the US lacks institutions that reliably make deep technical competence legible to capital; until that gap closes, innovation is throttled.

1. David Chapman - How To Think Real Good

-  **Core idea:** effective reasoning is mostly about _choosing and revising frames_ - not just using Bayes’ Theorem or any single formalism.
-  **Formulation first:** pick a vocabulary/level that makes the _relevant_ distinctions and compresses complexity; formulations aren’t “true/false”, only _useful_.
-  **Working heuristics:** start with concrete examples; solve a simpler version first, then iterate.
-  **Steal from everywhere:** learn broad maths, plus anthropology/psychology/philosophy; cultivate a “bag of tricks” so you can spot which tool fits which problem.
