1. **1. Scott Alexander — Against Individual IQ Worries**
  -  In this article, stresses a paradox: IQ is a powerful research tool in aggregate, but weak and misleading as a guide to any one person’s future.
  -  Measurement is shakier than official reliability stats suggest - fatigue, test context, or even caffeine intake can swing scores by 10–20 points.
  -  He points out that correlation at the population level (IQ predicting job performance, income, education) doesn’t translate into determinism at the individual level.
  -  Using analogies to family income, he reframes IQ as a structural influence - relevant to sociologists, but not a verdict on your life trajectory.
  -  Anecdotes (Feynman’s modest score, Reddit threads full of misaligned SAT vs IQ results) show the “statistically solid, individually shaky” dynamic in action. !
  -  This is not to say IQ tests aren’t valid. The real danger lies in misunderstanding correlation: either despairing in fatalism or denying all data outright. Alexander’s plea is for a mature statistical mindset.

1. **S. C. M. Paine - By Land or by Sea: Continental Power, Maritime Power, and the Fight for a New World Order**
  -  Paine argues that global rivalry is best understood through geography: continental powers (Russia, China, Iran) prioritise land, borders, and conquest; maritime powers (US, UK, Japan) build wealth through trade and naval dominance.
  -  Maritime states enjoy security from oceans, enabling them to focus on compounding prosperity and sustaining the rules-based order - whereas continental hegemons often destabilise neighbours, overextend, and collapse under their own weight.
  -  Historical cycles reinforce the thesis: Britain thrived by funding allies and protecting trade during the Napoleonic Wars; Germany, Japan, and the Soviet Union all weakened themselves by pursuing continental expansion.
  -  Today’s contests mirror these patterns: Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and China’s Belt and Road resemble traditional continental overreach, while US wavering between maritime openness and “America First” isolation risks undermining its natural advantage.
  -  Paine’s prescription is patience and economic strategy: sanctions as “economic chemotherapy,” alliances as additive strength, and prosperity as the weapon that outlasts authoritarian adventurism.
  -  The danger lies not in enemy brilliance but in self-inflicted blunders, a United States drifting into continental habits could squander the maritime order it created.

1. **Kristian Niemietz - High-Status Opinions vs Luxury Beliefs: The Economics of the Great Awokening**
  -  revisits his 2014 thesis that “woke” positions operate as _positional goods_, akin to Rolexes, but signalling moral or intellectual superiority rather than wealth.
  -  Using linguistic data, he traces the surge of terms like _white fragility_ and _intersectionality_ since 2014, framing the “Great Awokening” as a competitive display of high-status opinions.
  -  He contrasts this with ’s “luxury beliefs” theory - where elites hold socially costly beliefs insulated from consequences - arguing that survey evidence weakens the wealth-based framing.
  -  Instead, Niemietz stresses plural status hierarchies: moral, intellectual, cultural. High-status opinions allow progressives to differentiate themselves not from conservatives, but from moderates on their own side.
  -  The “package” effect matters: one high-status opinion reliably predicts many others. This clustering turns political identity into a form of conspicuous consumption: fashionable, shallow, and often hostile to dissent.
