1. **Solar Growth vs. Forecasts**
  -  Reality is running far ahead of expectation: in 2022, 252 GW of solar was added; 2023 jumped to ~392 GW; 2024 smashed through at 599 GW.
  -  Forecasts by the International Energy Agency (IEA) had projected a much slower, flatter trajectory - highlighting the habitual underestimation of clean tech adoption.
  -  Exponential curves are tricky: what looks “optimistic” often turns out to be conservative once deployment costs plummet and adoption cascades.
  -  The gap between “forecast” and “reality” matters, not just statistically but politically - undue pessimism can shape investment, infrastructure planning, and public policy. ![Image](/assets/images/substack/173126848-a4863a9c.webp)

### **The Power of Laconic Phrases**

-  Originating in Sparta, laconic phrases were terse, witty retorts designed to be both economical with words and devastating in impact.
-  Examples endure: when warned that Persian arrows would “block out the sun,” Spartans replied, “Then we shall fight in the shade.”
-  Laconism is different to brevity, it’s clarity sharpened by confidence, making every word carry maximum weight.
-  In an age of information overload, laconic phrasing finds new relevance: Twitter posts, slogans, and soundbites thrive on this ancient rhetorical skill.

1. **Seven Principles of Shipping (37signals)**
  -  For 37signals (makers of Basecamp, HEY, and others), “shipping” is the heartbeat of sustainable software development.
  -  Principle 1: _Ship only good work_ - no half-baked releases; 8/10 or better is the baseline.
  -  Principle 2: _Ship when confident_ - calibrate diligence to the criticality of the change, not just the checklist.
  - ⏳ Principle 3: _Ship when finished_ - don’t let projects languish behind flags; momentum is a quality of its own.
  -  Principle 4: _Own the issues after shipping_ - clean up your mess, balance fixes vs. feedback, keep moving.
  -  Principles 5–7: pause if it isn’t right, ship collective best effort, and ship to your “appetite” (time-boxing trade-offs).
  -  Taken together, they form a philosophy: pragmatic constraints, shared accountability, and respect for long-term code health.
