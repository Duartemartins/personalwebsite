1. - **“The Algorithm Will See You Now” (**) 
  -  _Context:_ Radiology is medicine’s most digitised domain - perfectly positioned for AI - but progress toward human replacement has been oddly sluggish. !
  -  _Performance paradox:_ CheXNet and its successors can outperform radiologists on lab benchmarks, yet models often collapse in real hospitals due to narrow training data, calibration gaps, and bias in under-represented demographics.
  -  _Regulatory drag:_ FDA approval demands separate validation for each retrain; malpractice insurers routinely write “absolute AI exclusions”. Hospitals thus keep humans “in the loop”.
  - ‍ _Task granularity:_ Only a third of a radiologist’s job is image interpretation - the rest is counselling, protocol design, and coordination - so automation hits diminishing returns quickly.
  -  _Elastic demand:_ As imaging got faster and cheaper with digital systems, scan volumes rose 60%. AI could similarly amplify throughput rather than eliminate jobs.
  -  _Moral:_ Radiology’s lesson is sociotechnical, not computational - the better the machines, the busier the humans.

1. **Scott Alexander - “The Fatima Sun Miracle: Much More Than You Wanted To Know” (Astral Codex Ten)**
  -  _Setup:_ In 1917, ~70,000 people at Fátima, Portugal, reported seeing the sun spin, flash colours, and plunge toward Earth - perhaps the most documented “miracle” in modern times.
  -  _Method:_ Alexander reconstructs 150+ testimonies from parish, diocesan, and newspaper archives - cross-checked via the _Documentação Crítica de Fátima_ - to test whether the event could be natural, optical, or sociological.
  -  _Findings:_ Descriptions vary - spinning discs, coloured rays, descending lights - but no consistent meteorological or astronomical correlate emerges. Perception, expectation, and optical illusion intertwine.
  -  _Epistemic lens:_ Crowds can synchronise beliefs under uncertainty; “mass testimony” isn’t strong evidence when witnesses share context, cues, and anticipation.
  -  _Meta-lesson:_ Belief formation under ambiguity mirrors modern cognitive bias - collective sincerity is not collective reliability.

1. **Economic Freedom & the Bottom 10%** 
  -  _Observation:_ Across nations, higher economic freedom correlates with higher _absolute_ incomes for the poorest decile. ![A scatter plot graph titled "Economic Freedom and Bottom 10% Income Threshold." The x-axis shows economic freedom scores ranging from 0 to 10, divided into categories like "Least Free Average" and "Freest Average." The y-axis displays income levels in 2021 US dollars, adjusted for purchasing power parity, ranging from $0 to $18,000. Data points represent countries such as Norway, Switzerland, and Bangladesh, plotted with varying colors indicating economic freedom levels. Text labels include country names and income values for the bottom 10% of the population.](/assets/images/substack/175356409-9e72fcd4.jpeg)
  -  _Scale:_ The bottom 10% earn roughly 7–8× more in the most-free economies than in the least-free - an absolute uplift even if their _share_ of national income is unchanged.
  -  _Mechanism:_ Freer markets often coincide with stronger property rights, business formation, and trade openness - raising productivity that reaches the poor.
  -  _Caveat:_ Correlation isn’t causation - human capital, governance, and culture co-move - but institutional quality appears a reliable predictor of welfare gains at the base.
  -  _Policy signal:_ Protect the rule of law and market dynamism _alongside_ redistribution if the goal is to raise real living standards for the poorest.
