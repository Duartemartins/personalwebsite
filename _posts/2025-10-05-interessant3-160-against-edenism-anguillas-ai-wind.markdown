1. **Peter Thiel - “Against Edenism” (First Things)**

-  _Thesis:_ Thiel warns that humanity’s nostalgia for a pre-technological Eden is misplaced. Genesis ends not in return to the Garden, but in the _City of God_ - a divine, engineered future.
-  He frames technology as moral necessity: without continual innovation, civilisation reverts to Malthusian scarcity where growth and democracy collapse.
-  The Enlightenment’s “Faustian” drive to master nature, he argues, was closer to the biblical impulse than today’s post-modern technophobia. To stop building is to surrender to chaos.
-  Thiel contrasts “atheist pessimism” - acceptance of chance and entropy - with Judeo-Christian optimism, which seeks order and mastery through God-given creativity.
-  In the eschatological frame, every act of engineering becomes co-creation with the divine: even Faust’s dykes and data centres can be instruments of providence.

1. **AI Pays the Bills — The Anguilla Revenue Revolution**
  -  In 2018, the tiny Caribbean island of Anguilla made just a few percent of its budget from selling _.ai_ domain names. By 2025, that figure hit ~50%.

Bars indicate revenue shares: 2018 at a low percentage, slight increases in 2019 and 2020, small rises in 2021 and 2022, a significant increase in 2023, and a peak at nearly 50% in 2025.](/assets/images/substack/175357940-60be56af.webp)
  -  The global AI boom has turned a country of 15,000 people into a digital landlord of the future - where every startup and lab pays rent.
  -  It’s a modern twist on resource economics: no oil, no rare earths - just two letters of the alphabet.
  -  The result: one of the world’s most dramatic fiscal transformations, powered purely by naming rights in cyberspace.
  -  A reminder that in a dematerialised economy, _symbolic capital_ - even a domain suffix - can become national wealth.

1. **The Pravda Gap - Fascism Falls Quiet, 1939–1941**
  -  Before 1939, Soviet newspaper _Pravda_ overflowed with denunciations of “fascists”. Then - silence.

Text at the top reads "Упомянаемость фамизма в газете 'Правда'" and includes years and percentages on the axes.

  -  From mid-1939 to mid-1941, references to fascism all but vanished from Soviet pages. The timing? The Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact.
  -  When Nazi Germany became a temporary ally of Socialist Russia, even ideological vocabulary bent to diplomacy.
  -  After June 1941 - Hitler’s invasion - the word returned in a flood. History’s data spike of cognitive dissonance resolved overnight.
