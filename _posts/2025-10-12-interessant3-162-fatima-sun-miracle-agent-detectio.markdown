1. - The Fatima Sun Miracle: Much More Than You Wanted To Know

-  13 Oct 1917, near solar noon: clouds part, a “painless” sun appears to spin, pulse through colours, and lurch downward; crowd panic ensues for ~10 minutes .
-  In a fascinating article, Scott Alexander tracks ~60 clean chains to original testimonies and church/parish inquiries; the shrine’s 633-page Documentação Crítica de Fátima (DCF) anchors much of the record, alongside contemporary press such as O Século and later Haffert interviews. 

!

-  Geography test: if the sun “really” moved, nearby towns should’ve seen it en masse. With ~300k people within 20 miles, we get only 4–6 credible outside-Fátima testimonies vs 100+ on site - awkward for a cosmological event, suggestive of localised perception dynamics .
-  Primed perception: similar “solar signs” were reported on earlier 13ths and in later pilgrimages, hinting at a repeatable psychophysical recipe - anticipation + crowd focus + glare viewing - rather than a one-off celestial anomaly. Incidentally one that appears rather common - there are reported sun miracles in Italy, Bosnia, and the Philippines, some regularly occurring to this day. 
-  Safety note from the author (and common sense): don’t stare at the sun—no, really

1. Agent detection - An interesting concept

-  Definition: our tendency to infer a purposeful agent behind ambiguous patterns (often framed as a “hyperactive agency detection device”).
-  Evolutionary wager: false positives cost little; false negatives can be fatal, so the system is biased to over-trigger.
-  Classic demos: Heider–Simmel animations, pareidolia, superstition; links to theory of mind, teleology, and the intentional stance.
-  Dial turns up under threat, uncertainty, or low control - helping explain spikes in conspiracism and supernatural attributions.
