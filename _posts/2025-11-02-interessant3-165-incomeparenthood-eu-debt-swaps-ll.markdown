Double issue this week.

1. DISIA Working Paper (2025) - “Income and Parenthood in Europe”

-  New cross-country evidence shows higher-income Europeans are now _more likely_ to become parents - a reversal of the late-20th-century pattern.
-  Gradients are positive for both men and women across most countries, suggesting constraints (housing, childcare, earnings volatility) weigh heaviest on lower incomes.

-  The shift hints that family policy is acting as a means test in practice: those with stable jobs and assets clear the hurdles; others postpone or opt out.
-  Methodologically, predicted probabilities rise steadily from income quintile 1→5, with tight CIs in large samples - robust across many national contexts.

1. Daniel Král - “A surprising reshuffle in Eurozone debt ratios”

-  Draft budgets imply  Greece’s debt/GDP will match (and then drop below)  Italy’s;  Portugal will fall _below_ the Eurozone average;  Cyprus to parity with  Netherlands.

-  Ten years ago this trajectory looked implausible - underscoring how growth, inflation composition, and primary surpluses can bend debt dynamics.
-  The message: fiscal positions are not destiny; composition of adjustment (reforms vs. austerity vs. windfalls) matters for credibility and rates.
-  Watch the dispersion: improvements at the periphery contrast with slower consolidation in some core economies, shifting the bloc’s risk map.

1. Arctotherium42 - “How LLMs trade off different lives”

-  Building on the Center for AI Safety’s “Utility Engineering” study, a new investigation probes how newer LLMs weight lives across nationalities and categories.

-  The approach elicits implicit value systems via structured moral trade-offs, revealing large and model-specific disparities.
-  Takeaway: alignment is about constraining emergent preferences that could systematically bias decisions at scale.
-  Calls for transparent benchmarking, dataset audits, and governance that treats moral generalisation as a testable property, not a by-product.
