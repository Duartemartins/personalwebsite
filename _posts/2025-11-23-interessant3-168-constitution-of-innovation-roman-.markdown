1. **, Bengt Holmström & Nicolas Petit – The Constitution of Innovation: A New European Renaissance**
  - The authors argue Europe has lost its economic edge by drifting from its original purpose: prosperity through market integration and innovation, not regulatory sprawl.
  - They detail how decades of growth were undone by bureaucratic overreach, with internal trade now hampered by the equivalent of 44% tariffs on goods and 110% on services.
 !
  - Proposals include ending the overuse of EU directives, establishing specialised commercial courts, enforcing true mutual recognition, and reviving a “28th regime” for pan-European business.
  - Central to their vision is revitalising _creative destruction_: enabling firm entry and exit, encouraging risk, and rewarding innovation over protectionism.

1. **Peter Temin – The Labor Supply of the Early Roman Empire**
  - Temin overturns the standard view of Ancient Rome as a static slave economy, arguing instead that a real, functional labour market existed across free and slave populations.
  - Roman slavery, unlike the closed systems of the Americas, was “open”: frequent manumission and legal integration of freedpeople created incentives akin to free-market dynamics.
  - Wage data suggests price responsiveness and regional comparability, with slaves and free workers alike participating in markets for skilled and unskilled labour.
  - Educated slaves were common, and the expectation of eventual freedom gave many an incentive structure similar to that of indentured servants or employees on performance contracts.
  - The labour market in Rome, especially urban centres, mirrored early modern Europe more than feudal economies, responsive, incentivised, and socially mobile (at least for some).

1. **UNICEF – State of the World’s Children 2023**
  - **Excellent**  **news** : from 2000 to 2023, the share of children facing “severe deprivation” dropped from 65.1% to 40.6%, a global shift driven not by income, but by access to basic services.
  - This multidimensional metric includes education, water, sanitation, housing, nutrition, and health, not just money.
  - Gains came from infrastructure investment, health initiatives, and expanded schooling, though progress has slowed in fragile and climate-exposed regions.
