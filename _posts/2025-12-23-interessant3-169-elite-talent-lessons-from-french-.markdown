Sending you a Christmas present of four issues of Interessant3 so you can have plenty to read in your down time.

1. **David Epstein et al. - Early Specialisation vs Long Run Excellence** _Science_
  - A large scale analysis of elite careers, from Nobel laureates to Olympic champions, tests whether early specialisation really produces the best outcomes.

  - Intensive single discipline training delivers an early performance advantage, but that advantage steadily fades.

  - Individuals exposed to multiple domains early on tend to progress more slowly at first.
  - Over time, these late specialisers are more likely to reach true world class status.
  - Early specialists often plateau just below the very top of their field.
  - The results support a “sampling first, specialising later” model of long term excellence.

1. **- How France Built 40 Nuclear Reactors in a Decade**
  - In the 1970s and 1980s France rolled out a fleet of standardised pressurised water reactors at remarkable speed.
  - Centralised planning and strong political consensus reduced delays and regulatory friction.
  - Bulk ordering and design standardisation drove costs down and shortened construction timelines.

  - Local subsidies, tax incentives, and state coordination aligned incentives across industry, labour, and government.
  - The programme ultimately delivered around 70 percent of France’s electricity from nuclear power.
  - The article argues these lessons remain relevant for countries seeking rapid, low carbon energy today.

1. **Axios AI Is Creating More Work, Countering the Doomers for Now** _Human Progress_
  - New labour market data challenges fears of widespread AI driven job destruction: analysis from Vanguard shows both wages and employment rising fastest in occupations most exposed to AI.
  - From mid 2023 to mid 2025, **real wages rose 3.8 percent in high AI exposure roles, compared with 0.7 percent elsewhere**.
  - Job growth in these roles reached 1.7 percent, more than double the rate of lower exposure occupations.
  - The findings suggest AI is currently augmenting work rather than replacing it.
  - The central risk lies in uneven adaptation, not an overall shortage of jobs.
