1. **Is the UK Heading for Net-Zero Immigration?**
  - UK net migration, after peaking in 2022 at nearly one million, is now projected to fall to zero by late 2026.
  - The reversal is partly driven by post-pandemic correction and policy tightening, but also a changing global labour market. Student visa changes, work visa caps, and public sentiment are converging to reshape the UK’s migration model.

  - The political implications are stark: if current projections hold, immigration may cease to be the wedge issue it once was.

1. **Pay Transparency Laws – Simon Quach et al.**
  - When Colorado and other US states required salary disclosure in job listings, the results defied expectations and led to a 2% overall salary increase.
  - Pay rose across the board, especially for lower earners, without affecting employment rates or skill demands.
  - Transparency intensified competition among employers and improved workers’ bargaining power. Labour market efficiency improved as information asymmetry between employers and applicants shrank.
  - The findings suggest simple policy nudges can rebalance labour markets without regulation-heavy intervention.Link: [Pay Transparency and the Labor Market – Quach, Sung, Qin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SimonQuach1/Papers/main/pay_transparency.pdf)

1. **Sarah Paine – How Hitler Almost Starved Britain (via** )
  - In this lecture, Sarah Paine draws lessons from Britain’s WWII strategy- peripheral warfare, sea control, and alliance-building.
  - She argues these principles still apply today, with Russia and China constrained by continental geography and internal vulnerabilities.
  - The lecture contrasts Bismarck’s limited wars with Hitler’s overreach, showing how geography and naval power shaped outcomes. Paine sees maritime alliances as a natural advantage for liberal powers, able to pressure rivals at lower cost and political risk.

  - Geography, logistics, and industrial base, rather than ideology, remain the decisive forces in modern great power competition.
