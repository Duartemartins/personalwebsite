Hello and welcome to my blog! It’s a space where I jot down my thoughts on subjects I find intriguing: technology, our complex society, and occasionaly a bit of philosophy.

I’m a believer in letting data tell the tale, whether it’s a deep-dive into tech developments or a casual observation on day-to-day life.

You’ll find a variety of posts here:

- **Tech Insights**: Web development and programming in a way that’s both useful and engaging.
- **Social Commentary**: Observing the dynamics of society with a keen, analytical eye.
- **Philosophical Thoughts**: Sharing reflections on life’s bigger questions and the little things that make us wonder.

From practical guides to snippets of interesting finds in my 'Interessant3' series, I hope there’s something here to pique your interest.

Feel free to connect with me across the web. I’m on [GitHub](https://github.com/duartemartins), I share three interesting things once a week on [Substack](https://interessant3.substack.com), engaging in discourse on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/duarteosrm), and mirror this blog on (Medium)[https://medium.com/@duartem].

I'm currently working on [PopaDex](https://popadex.com) and [DeepDive](https://trydeepdive) whenever I can.

I’d love for you to share your thoughts, and maybe we’ll learn something new together.
